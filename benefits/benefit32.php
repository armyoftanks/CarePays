              <h1>Small Business Legal Plan</h1>
              <p>With a national average hourly rate of $381, contacting an attorney for your business may seem out of reach.&nbsp; Give your members access to free and discounted rates on services from experienced lawyers. Attorneys help with business contracts, copyright, patents, UCC filings, tax law, employment matters and more.&nbsp; Additional services are also available at no cost.</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Free services* include unlimited initial phone consultations during business hours, attorney-made phone calls, legal document review (5 per quarter up to 10 pages each), collection letters (10 per quarter), initial letters written on behalf of your business and deemed appropriate by the plan attorney</li>
                  <li>Attorneys only charge $125 an hour or 40% off their hourly rate, whichever is greater</li>
                  <li>Discounts on contingency-based cases</li>
                  <li>Members are referred to plan attorneys based on location, language and area of law</li>
              </ul>
              <p><em>*In certain situations, attorney liability may require plan attorneys to ask for a retainer prior to providing some of the free legal services.</em></p>
